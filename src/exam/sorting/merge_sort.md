**Comprehensive Mock Test on Merge Sort Algorithm in Lisp**

1. **Basics of Merge Sort:** Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that recursively splits a list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back into a sorted list.
   - *Page Reference: 113*

2. **Divide and Conquer Strategy:** Merge sort divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts each recursively, and then merges the sorted sublists. This strategy improves performance by breaking down the problem into manageable parts.
   - *Page Reference: 114*

3. **Performance of Merge Sort:** Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for larger lists, especially where random access is not as efficient, such as with linked lists.
   - *Page Reference: 114*

4. **Advantages Over Other Sorting Algorithms:** Merge sort is stable and has consistent O(n log n) performance, unlike quicksort which can degrade to O(n^2). It's particularly efficient for sorting linked lists and large data sets.
   - *Page Reference: 113*

5. **Handling Large Lists:** Merge sort is effective for large lists due to its O(n log n) complexity and divide-and-conquer approach, which breaks down the list into smaller, more manageable sublists for sorting.
   - *Page Reference: 114*

6. **Recursive Nature of Merge Sort:** Recursion in merge sort allows the algorithm to continuously divide the list into smaller sublists until they are trivially sortable (one or zero elements), before merging them back together.
   - *Page Reference: 114*

7. **Memory Usage in Merge Sort:** Merge sort requires additional memory for the merging process, unlike in-place sorting algorithms. This extra memory is proportional to the size of the list being sorted.

**Advanced Mock Test on Merge Sort Algorithm in Lisp**

1. **Merge Sort Divide-and-Conquer:** Merge sort in Lisp uses the divide-and-conquer strategy by recursively dividing a list into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging them back into a sorted list.
   - *Page Reference: 113*

2. **Merge Sort vs. Quick Sort:** Compare merge sort with quicksort in terms of performance and stability.
   - Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm with a consistent O(n log n) time complexity, regardless of the input distribution. Quicksort, while generally faster, can degrade to O(n^2) in the worst case.
   - *Page Reference: 115*

3. **Handling Duplicate Elements:** Merge sort handles duplicate elements by maintaining the order of equal elements, ensuring a stable sort.
   - *Page Reference: 114*

4. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity of merge sort in Lisp is O(n), as it requires additional space to store the sublists during the merge phase.
   - *Page Reference: 114*

5. **Merge Sort for Linked Lists:** Merge sort is well-suited for sorting linked lists because it does not require random access to elements.
   - *Page Reference: 113*

6. **Base Cases in Merge Sort:** The base cases in merge sort occur when the list is empty or contains only one element, at which point the list is already sorted.
   - *Page Reference: 114*

7. **Merge Sort in Functional Programming:** Merge sort is advantageous in functional programming languages like Lisp because it aligns well with recursive patterns and immutable data structures.
