**Step 1: Define a movie structure**
- Use the `(defstruct movie ...)` syntax to create a structure named "movie" with four fields: title, director, year, and type. This structure will represent a movie's attributes.

**Step 2: Create the "ADD-MOVIE" function**
- Define the function `(defun add-movie (movie-to-add array) ...)`.
- Calculate the length of the input array and initialize a variable `title-exists` to `nil`.
- Enter a loop to iterate over the array using `(loop for i from 0 below array-size do ...)`.
- Within the loop, check if the movie title already exists in the array using `(string= (movie-title movie) (movie-title movie-to-add))`.
- If the title exists, set `title-exists` to `t`.
- After the loop, check if `title-exists` is `t`. If so, return `nil` to indicate that the movie was not added.
- If `title-exists` is `nil`, enter another loop to find an empty slot in the array. When an empty slot is found, add the new movie to that slot using `(setf (aref array i) movie-to-add)`. Then, return the updated array.

**Step 3: Implement the "DELETE-MOVIE" function**
- Define the function `(defun delete-movie (title-to-delete array) ...)`.
- Calculate the length of the input array and initialize a variable `deleted` to `nil`.
- Enter a loop to iterate over the array using `(loop for i from 0 below array-size do ...)`.
- Within the loop, check if the movie title matches the one to delete using `(string= (movie-title movie) title-to-delete)`.
- If a match is found, set the slot in the array to `nil` using `(setf (aref array i) nil)` and set `deleted` to `t`.
- After the loop, if any movie was deleted (`deleted` is `t`), return the updated array; otherwise, return `nil`.

**Step 4: Develop the "NUM-MOVIES" function**
- Define the function `(defun num-movies (array) ...)`.
- Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of movies.
- Enter a loop to iterate over the elements in the input array using `(loop for movie across array do ...)`.
- Within the loop, check if the element is not `nil` and, if so, increment the `count` variable using `(incf count)`.
- After looping through all elements, return the `count` variable, which represents the number of non-null elements in the array.

**Step 5: Test the functions**
- Create an array `a` with four initial empty slots using `(make-array 4 :initial-element nil)`.
- Print the initial state of the array with `(print a)`.
- Use the `add-movie` function to add a movie to the array, print the result, then delete the movie and print the result again.
- Finally, use the `num-movies` function to count the number of movies in the array and print the result.
