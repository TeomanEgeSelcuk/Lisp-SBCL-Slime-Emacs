**Step 1: Define the PERSON structure**
- Create a structure named "person" using `(defstruct person ...)` with two slots: "name" (string) and "age" (integer). This structure will represent an individual's name and age.

**Step 2: Define the FILTER-AGES function**
- Define a function named `filter-ages` using `(defun filter-ages (people age-threshold) ...)`.
- Create a new array `result` with initial size 0, set as adjustable with a fill pointer at 0. This allows the array to grow dynamically.
- Enter a loop that iterates over each `person` structure in the input `people` array.
  - Check if the age of the current `person` is greater than the specified `age-threshold`.
  - If the condition is met, push the `person`'s name into the `result` array using `vector-push-extend`.
- Return the `result` array containing the names of individuals whose age exceeds the given threshold.

**Step 3: Define the ARRAY-GROUP function**
- Define a function named `array-group` using `(defun array-group (array1 array2) ...)`.
- Calculate the lengths of the input arrays `array1` and `array2` and store them in `len1` and `len2`, respectively.
- Create a new array `result` with a size equal to the maximum length of the input arrays, set as adjustable with a fill pointer at 0.
- Enter a loop that iterates from 0 up to the maximum length of the input arrays (the larger of `len1` and `len2`).
  - For each index `i`, create a vector containing elements from `array1` and `array2` at the same index `i`.
  - Use `vector-push-extend` to add this vector to the `result` array.
  - If an index is out of bounds for either of the input arrays, fill the corresponding element with `nil`.
- Return the `result` array, which contains subarrays with corresponding elements from `array1` and `array2`, padded with `nil` where needed.

These functions enable you to filter people based on age and group elements from two arrays together while handling size adjustments dynamically.
