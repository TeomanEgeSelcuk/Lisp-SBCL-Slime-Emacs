;; O(1) - Constant Time:
;; - Operations with constant runtime, independent of input size.
;; - Examples: Array element access, hash table lookup, simple arithmetic.

;; O(log n) - Logarithmic Time:
;; - Runtime increases logarithmically with input size.
;; - Example: Binary search in sorted data.

;; O(n) - Linear Time:
;; - Runtime is directly proportional to input size.
;; - Example: Iterating through a list or array with a single loop.

;; O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time:
;; - Runtime is a product of linear and logarithmic growth.
;; - Examples: Merge sort, heap sort.

;; O(n^2) - Quadratic Time:
;; - Runtime is proportional to the square of input size.
;; - Common with nested loops iterating over the same data.

;; O(2^n) - Exponential Time:
;; - Exponential growth in runtime with input size.
;; - Typically seen in recursive algorithms with multiple recursive calls.

;; O(n!) - Factorial Time:
;; - Runtime grows as the factorial of input size.
;; - Often encountered in problems involving permutations and combinations.
